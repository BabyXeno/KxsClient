## Fork of SoyAlguen Client  

[KxsClient](https://kxs.rip) started as a fork of the original SoyAlguen client. After countless hours of work, the [KxsClient](https://kxs.rip) has evolved into something entirely different.  

Unlike SoyAlguen, [KxsClient](https://kxs.rip) is not a script to replace on the Surviv.io page. Instead, it's a script that can be loaded using a script manager (like Tampermonkey).  
This means [KxsClient](https://kxs.rip) works seamlessly on any web browser that supports custom scripts ðŸ˜Ž
